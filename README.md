# web-app-boiler

# Contents
This boiler contains the bones for a React 18 front end, an ExpressJS server, and a PostgresSQL database.

# To run
- Clone this repo into the appropriate folder on your local machine.
- npm i react react-dom react-scripts
- npm i express
- npm i pg
- npm i react-router-dom

npm i also installs nodemon, if you want it.

running `npm run client:dev` should get the front end going!

From there you can build your database and web server! Good luck.

# Set up github repo
- Don't forget this part.
